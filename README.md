This is just a fun little project I wanted to work on over christmas after playing a bunch of Elite, and Oregon Trail, and other such games.  
The idea was to create a little system that allowed you to buy and sell things as if you were a fantasy shopkeeper.  
Definitely not the most complex system I've ever put together, but that's ok. It's not going to become anything interesting - it's more just for my own personal benefit than anything else.  

Worth noting - When I finish this project, I'm probably not coming back to it. Though that's not a certainty. That being said, when I hit the deadline (Tuesday 4th Jan 2022) I'll upload the game to twitch and call it there. I might keep working on it in my free time, and might even update the itch page, but I wouldn't expect anything much

Either way, hope you enjoy having a little play around with this. Projects like this always make me slightly nostalgic for things like the original Elite, Oregon Trail and things like that.  
Cheers
